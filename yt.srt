00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,078
Today, I've got an exciting news to share with you.

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:06,694
Streamlet is hosting the Lom hackathon that is happening from

3
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:10,126
September 5 to September 19. Now, before we dive

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,694
into the details of the hackathon, let's talk a little bit about Streamlet.

5
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:17,814
Streamlet is a low code web framework that allows you to create

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,526
data apps in Python using a simple API.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,190
It's no secret that Streamlet has become the go to platform for building

8
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:29,594
LLM based apps. In fact, they already have over 12,000

9
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:33,426
apps accounting in their community, and developers

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,570
are unlocking new possibilities using large language models.

11
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:41,746
Streamlet has partnered with some of the leaders in LLM based technology,

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,242
including Lancing, Llamaindex,

13
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:48,610
AssemblyAI, Weviate, and Clarify. These partnerships

14
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:52,130
means you'll have access to top notch tools and expertise

15
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,614
while participating in the hackathon.

16
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:58,814
So what's this hackathon all about? It's your chance

17
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:02,078
to build a groundbreaking LOM based streamlet

18
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:06,678
app that incorporates at least one of the following LOM technologies

19
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:09,694
from these partners, including Lancing,

20
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:14,158
AssemblyAI, Wev, eight, Llamaindex, or clarify.

21
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:18,014
There will be five price categories, one for each

22
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:21,974
partner listed above, and in each category there will be two lucky app

23
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:25,374
winners. You can participate solo, or you could

24
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:28,702
also partner up in a team of two, and winners will

25
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:32,086
be announced by October 5. So if you're wondering how

26
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,494
your app creation will be judged, these are the criterias.

27
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:38,654
So they're looking for inventive and error free apps,

28
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:42,062
and that the app should be public on GitHub and also

29
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,542
hosted on the community cloud. The app should also use one

30
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:49,198
of the five partner technologies mentioned here, and bonus

31
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:52,710
points if it is addressing common LLM pain

32
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:55,758
points like transparency, trust, accuracy,

33
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:59,718
privacy, cost reduction or ethics. And here's the exciting

34
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:03,046
part. There are five most innovative used prize categories,

35
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,446
each category corresponding to one of the partner technologies.

36
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,862
And in each of the categories, as already mentioned, there will

37
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:13,526
be two lucky app winners. Aside from the special swag

38
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,914
from the two winning apps in each of the category,

39
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:21,546
the first 250 apps submitted will receive a pair of streamlit socks.

40
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,122
Yes, you heard that right, streamlet socks. Now, before you

41
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:28,866
get started, there are plenty of resources to help you on your

42
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,314
LLM hackathon journey. Firstly, you could join the LLM

43
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:36,034
hackathon channel on the Streamlit discord, and there are tutorial

44
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:39,626
blogs in starting with these technologies. If you

45
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,520
need some inspiration, you can check out the example LLM apps like

46
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:47,256
building a chatbot, building a web eight magic the gathering

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,200
chat building a chat research using LangChain using custom

48
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,720
data sources using Lambda index? Or how

49
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:58,936
about analyzing video channels automatically using AssemblyAI?

50
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,844
Or interact with models via chatbots using clarify.

51
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:06,592
When you're done with your app creation, don't forget to submit it and be a

52
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:10,602
part of this incredible LM hackathon journey. So mark your calendars.

53
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,994
You have from September 5 until the 19th to take

54
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:17,402

55
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,266
collaborate, and make a real impact using ln technology. I'll also be

56
